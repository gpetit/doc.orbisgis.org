Components 
========

Here is a list of the main components of OrbisGIS. Except the map, each of them can be hidden or not, replaced and (un)docked.

To load a component, check the list in the "Windows" menu.


The Geocatalog
---------------

The Geocatalog is the place where datasources are managed. Through a right-click in the blank area, the user can:

- Add a datasource,
- Import a datasource in OrbisGIS,
- Remove a datasource,
- Clear the Geocatalog : all the sources are removed from OrbisGIS,
- Show the attributes tables
- Export layers into flat files or databases.

The Map
---------------

The map is the place where geographic informations (vector or raster) is displayed. The user can navigate into the map, using zoom or pan tools.


TOC
---------------

TOC stands for "Table Of Content". The TOC allows the user to:

- Make visible or not the layer with the checkbox (on the left),
- Change the layer name --> make a double-click on the layer. change the name and press “Entrer”.
- Change the order of layers --> drag & drop the layer upward or downward,

Moreover, several features are available via a right-click:

- Edit legend : To change the appearance of the layer or to make a thematic analysis
- Zoom to layer : Extended zoom on the layer
- Export : Save the layer in a file (e.g : a shape file) or in a database
- Remove layer : Remove the layer from the TOC
- Show attributes : show the attributes's table
- Start edition : To edit a layer (e.g: add a field, delete an object, …)


DB Tree
---------------

The DB Tree is a tree representation of all layers loaded in OrbisGIS. Layers (tables) are listed into their respectives folder (views).
Specific options allows the user to:

- create (spatial) index
- add / remove columns

Output console
---------------

The output console is the place where all messages (informations, logs or errors) are displayed.

SQL console
---------------

The SQL console is the place where the user can execute SQL scripts. This console can be considered as a text editor. The user is able to

- Load & Save .sql files,
- Write instructions,
- Search & Replace words (with advanced options),
- Share SQL instructions via email (need a specific plugin),
- To auto-complete instructions (see more below)

**Auto-completion**

To use the auto-completion, just press "Ctrl + Space". For example, if you write “sel” and then press “Ctrl + Space”, OrbisGIS will recognize that you want to write “SELECT”. In the same spirit, if you start writing the name of a function, a table or field, a dropdown list will appear on the right to offer you the corresponding elements.
